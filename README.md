# DDLC-3DS
A Doki Doki Literature Club port for the 3DS! Programmed in Lua, running under the LÃ–VEPotion framework.

Save files and character files are located at /3ds/data/LovePotion/DDLC-3DS/ on the SD card. The character files are generated on the first run. You can reset the save data and start over by deleting all of the save*.sav files on that folder.

Until a fix is found, New 3DS/2DS users should disable L2 Cache before playing this.

This is an unofficial Doki Doki Literature Club port that is not affiliated with Team Salvato. It is designed to be played only after the official game has been completed. You can download Doki Doki Literature Club at: http://ddlc.moe


Building:

You cannot build DDLC-3DS on your own. you have to add it to LovePotion, replace the makefile and meta files, and compile it with the game folder.
